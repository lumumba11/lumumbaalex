"As a Cybersecurity Analyst and Informatics student, scripting is one of the most valuable tools in my arsenal. 
Whether it’s automating tasks or analyzing data, scripting languages help improve efficiency and precision."

## Why Scripting Matters in Cybersecurity

Inline example: `alert = f"Port {port} is open"` — this kind of dynamic string generation is useful in logging and notifications.

## JavaScript for Client-Side Simulations

In cybersecurity, JavaScript can simulate client-side behavior for XSS testing or web application analysis:

```javascript
let username = prompt('Enter username')
let password = prompt('Enter password')
let token = btoa(username + ':' + password) // Encode credentials for testing (never in production)
console.log('Simulated Auth Token:', token)
