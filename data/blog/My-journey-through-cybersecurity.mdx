# My Journey Through Informatics, Cybersecurity, and Web Development

I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student at **Moi University**, pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Informatics**. My academic journey has been shaped by a deep curiosity about how technology works — and more importantly, how it can be protected. That curiosity led me into the world of **cybersecurity**.

## Discovering Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity isn't just a buzzword to me — it's a passion. In my spare time, I explore ethical hacking, penetration testing, and the tools professionals use to test and strengthen digital defenses. I enjoy breaking things (legally) to understand how to secure them.

Whether it's practicing with **Kali Linux**, experimenting with **Nmap**, **Burp Suite**, or analyzing exploit reports on platforms like **Hack The Box**, I enjoy solving complex problems that require critical thinking and technical depth.

## Web Development: Building and Securing

While hacking focuses on breaking things down, **web development** is about building them up. I work on websites and applications — not just to create functional platforms but also to understand their vulnerabilities from the inside out.

I use **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and other modern tools to design responsive, clean, and secure user experiences. Web development complements my cybersecurity knowledge by showing me what’s at stake when systems are left unsecured.

## Life Beyond the Screen

When I'm not buried in code or reading about exploits, I enjoy a good game of football — especially when **Manchester United** is playing. I’m also a proud fan of **reggae music**, which brings rhythm and reflection to my everyday life.

## Looking Ahead

As I continue with my studies and hands-on work, my goal is to specialize further in **offensive security** and eventually contribute to real-world digital defense strategies. Cybersecurity is more than just a career path for me — it's a mindset of constant learning, adapting, and defending.

Thanks for joining me on this journey. Stay tuned for more blog posts as I document what I learn and build — one project at a time.
