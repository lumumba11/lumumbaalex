# About Me

Hey there 👋, I’m **Sir Alex Lumumba**, a third-year undergraduate student at **Moi University**, where I’m pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Informatics**. My academic path has provided a solid foundation in computing, data management, and information systems—but my true passion lies in **cybersecurity**.

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Enthusiast

When I’m not in class, I’m usually deep into penetration testing, threat analysis, or reverse engineering malware. I’m self-driven and always exploring new security concepts—from **ethical hacking** and **network security** to **AI-powered defense mechanisms**. I believe in using my skills for good, protecting systems before attackers can exploit them.

## 🖥️ Developer at Heart

In addition to cybersecurity, I’m also into **web development**. I build responsive, secure, and fast websites using modern stacks like **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. Whether it’s a personal blog or a client project, I enjoy blending functionality with sleek design.

## ⚽ Football & 🎵 Reggae Vibes

Away from tech, I’m a proud **Manchester United** fan (no matter what the league table says 😅) and a huge **reggae music** enthusiast. The rhythm and conscious lyrics of reggae inspire me the same way solving security puzzles does—it’s all about focus, balance, and rhythm.

## 🧭 My Mission

My goal is simple: to grow as a **cybersecurity analyst**, contribute to the **ethical hacking** community, and help individuals and businesses understand the importance of **digital security**.

This blog is a place where I share my thoughts, guides, tools, and experiences—from breaking down complex security concepts to writing about real-world incidents and emerging tech trends.

Let’s secure the future—one line of code at a time.
